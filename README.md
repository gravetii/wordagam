A fun & interactive word game. Check out the screenshots!
If you're interested in the implementation details, check out [my article on Medium](https://sandeepdasika.medium.com/how-i-built-a-simple-word-game-in-java-using-javafx-8fba925b71c6).

## Download & Play

Download the latest artefacts [here](https://github.com/gravetii/wordagam/releases/tag/v3.0). You can download the MacOS artifact [here](https://github.com/gravetii/wordagam/releases/download/v3.0/wordagam-mac.zip), but artefacts for other platforms can also be built easily. Check the `Building from source` section below.

After downloading the zip file, extract it and run `wordagam` -  

```
./wordagam-mac/bin/wordagam
```

You can download an older version of the game as a JAR file [here](https://github.com/gravetii/wordagam/releases/download/v1.6/wordagam-1.6.jar).

## Prerequisites

The latest version of the artifact doesn't require a pre-existing Java runtime. This is possible because the project makes use of `jlink` to create a custom runtime image which comes bundled with the Java runtime.

## Building from source

The project is built as a modular Kotlin application using gradle. You can build the project and create a custom runtime image for your platform using `jlink`. Run this in the root folder of the project - 
```
./gradlew clean jlink
```

Running this command creates the runtime image which you can run to play the game - 
```
build/image/bin/wordagam
```
